# SarnFan

SarnFan is a platform designed to bridge the gap between schools in need and individuals or organizations willing to help. By addressing key challenges in educational inequality, SarnFan empowers communities to contribute resources, financial aid, and volunteer services to underprivileged schools in Thailand.

## üåç **Purpose**
SarnFan aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), targeting:
- **UNSDG 1:** No Poverty
- **UNSDG 4:** Quality Education
- **UNSDG 10:** Reduced Inequalities
- **UNSDG 11:** Sustainable Cities and Communities
- **UNSDG 17:** Partnerships for the Goals

By fostering a culture of giving and collaboration, SarnFan supports schools and communities in building sustainable, equitable futures.

## üè´ **Problem Statement**
Educational inequality in Thailand disproportionately affects rural and underprivileged areas:
- Schools lack essential resources like textbooks, computers, and basic supplies.
- Facilities such as toilets, desks, and chairs are in poor condition.
- Learning environments like playgrounds and gardens require significant improvement.

Despite the willingness of donors, volunteers, and organizations to help, there is no centralized platform to connect them with schools in need. SarnFan serves as the "middle space" to close this gap and facilitate meaningful contributions.

- **Contribute Easily:** Donors can provide items, services, or funds based on the specific needs of schools.
